# Portfolio Website

## Goal

Consolidate my knowledge of JavaScript/JSON/Async/Fetch/Promise.

## Composition

The website is fairly simple: no framework used, just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. Everything is homemade, except for the royalty-free background image and the GitHub and LinkedIn branding icons. No SQL database query (not necessary given the scope of this site).
