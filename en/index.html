                        <p class="reveal">Deeply rooted in computer science since the age of two, I first discovered my fascination with programming through video game modding. For a long time, it seemed to me to be merely a hobby, and I never dared to consider it as a potential career path. Recently, I have begun to refine my skills and have immersed myself in web development.</p>

                        <p class="reveal">Nowadays, I spend my free time learning new concepts and improving my skills as I work on projects. I'm always striving to reach new goals and reinforce what I've learned. I know I still have much to learn, but I'm convinced that my all-consuming passion for programming and web development will get me there.</p>
